**Relearning JavaScript (with Deno in Jupyter)**

Join me as I refresh my JavaScript skills using Deno within Jupyter Notebook/Lab. Let's explore the language and build projects together!

**Setup**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ratatatatcode/learn-javascript.git](https://github.com/ratatatatcode/learn-javascript.git)
    cd learn-javascript
    ```

2.  **Install Deno:**
    * Follow the official Deno installation instructions for your operating system: [https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation)

3.  **Install Python and JupyterLab/Notebook:**
    * Ensure you have Python installed.
    * Install JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook using pip:
        ```bash
        pip install jupyterlab  # or pip install notebook
        ```

4.  **Install the Deno Jupyter Kernel:**
    * This step is crucial for running Deno code inside Jupyter.
        ```bash
        deno jupyter --install
        ```

5.  **Launch JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook:**
    * Start JupyterLab:
        ```bash
        jupyter lab
        ```
    * Or start Jupyter Notebook:
        ```bash
        jupyter notebook
        ```

6.  **Open an Existing Notebook or Create a New One:**
    * Open one of the provided `.ipynb` files from the repository, or create a new notebook and select the "Deno" kernel. Try running some Deno code!

Now you're ready to start writing and executing Deno (JavaScript/TypeScript) code within Jupyter!
